# 🎭 JokesterBot - A Fun Discord Bot  

JokesterBot is a simple yet fun Discord bot built using Python and `discord.py`. It provides interactive commands and can be easily extended with new features.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ Slash command `/hello` – The bot responds with a friendly "Hello! 👋"  
✅ Customizable with more commands and interactions  
✅ Uses **environment variables** to store sensitive data securely  
✅ Built with `discord.ext.commands` for better command handling

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnilabhBarua/JokesterBot_Discord.git

## 🤖 Adding More Features

```python
@bot.tree.command(name="joke", description="Get a random joke!")
async def joke(interaction: discord.Interaction):
    await interaction.response.send_message("Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side! 🐔")
```
